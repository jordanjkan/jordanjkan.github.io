*Why did you choose M.I.S.?*

Before I even answer that question, I first challenged myself to wonder what I would major in. When I first had to think about that question in High School, a lot of different majors popped up in my head. For a while, I was pretty set on a small selection of majors I had picked out, but as the months and years went by and the time to go to University arrived, I was stumped. I had no idea what I wanted to major in. So I started backtracking, I thought about my background, interests, and future. I knew I wanted to go into business due to growing up in my family's own business and being semi-familiar with the environment. I then hopped from one possiblity to the next, pondering how my future would look like based off of what major I would decide on. After long bouts of research and thought, I decided on M.I.S. My brother graduating with an M.I.S. degree also aided in my decision. I do believe the ability to use and be fluent in information systems is a strong ability to have in this day and age, and will continue to be so. That is why I chose M.I.S.
