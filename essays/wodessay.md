*My Experience with the first 3 WODs.*

I initially thought the WODs were going to be a walk in the park. When reading the instructions about what to do on the WOD and looking at the different timer scsores, it seems quite simple. Once I started my screencast and got my tabs and applications ready to work on the WOD, I was quite confident and sped through the simple set up tasks for the WOD files. I quickly realized how difficult it would actually be when asked to perform tasks without any specific instructions or guidance. Although it does give you free will in what you write, it an also become difficult to remember what to write. I found that I got stuck easily and the pressure bore on as I saw the time twindle and pass each score whilst I didn't know what to do. It's difficult to get out of that situation especially when you have to restrain yourself from looking stuff up. That was my experience for practically every first attempt at a WOD. It was beneficial though, without directions on how to complete a certain task, I would come up with new ways to execute the task through trial and error. Yes it took time and would result in DNF's but I always had more attempts. After my first attempt and a second one if I still got stuck, I would resort to the screencast which gave a clean cut way to complete the WOD. My advice would be to not be afraid to fail or be pressured to first-try the WOD and be willing to make mistakes to expand your learning, then use the screencast to solidify the proper skills and make sense of the things you tried or failed at.
