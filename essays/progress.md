My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
I've gained a better understanding on how functions, files, statements, algorithms, etc. all work together to perform a process. My comprehension of what lines of code actually mean and how that code interacts with the server and other programs to perform a task has improved from when I first started. 

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills: I still struggle with coming up with lines of code and processes by myself. I am not knowledgeable enough to be able to instantly know what to do when coming across a task, sometimes even seemingly simpler ones.

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast: WODs have definitely helped me reach a better understanding of how to program things myself. I can technically do them without copying the screencast but it is not as fast nor is it as efficient as the screencast. 

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence: The labs in class do help break down the lab instructions and concepts though doing the labs by myself is different. I am not entirely confident in completing the labs, I haven't had problems so far but I would not say they are in confidence as labs take me a while to do.

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2: Assignment 1 was definitely eye-opening and the way it was structured led a greater opportunity for self-guided learning. I have recognized a lot of errors I have committed in Assignment 1 and will keep them in mind for Assignment 2, but as always I am still a little apprehensive in my abilities.

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways: To be honest, I am not too sure. There is help available and there's resources available to us. If there was anything we don't know we are expected to RTFM it so I feel like there isn't much to already improve on.

What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.): The labs/work we do in class is helpful. It helps me comprehend the things we are learning especially as I see Professor Port explain the code and write it in real-time and execute it in real-time.
